This is a chrome extension designed to add a bit of missing functionality to the singletrackworld forums.
This will all break when they update!

TODO
----
Feedback from users has suggested that these would be handy features:
+ Return to thread at last point (not sure if possible, biggest issue would be working out where in the page the user was when they left)
+ User notes/tags
+ Number of unread posts (killfile appears to have started this but not finished...so must be possible!)
+ A marker to easily distguish your username
